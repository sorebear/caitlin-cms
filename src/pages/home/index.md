          The International Coaching Federation defines coaching as a
          “partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process
          that inspires the client to maximize their personal and professional
          potential.” A coach helps the client clarify their vision, determine
          core values, investigate their current reality and commit to something
          new.


          In short, a coach helps you get from where you are to where you want
          to go.
