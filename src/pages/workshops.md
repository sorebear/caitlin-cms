          Have you ever asked the question, “What does it mean to BE a leader?”
          Most of us learn a set of leadership tactics (do this, don’t do that)
          and are then confused when these tactics don’t universally work the
          way we want them to! In Thrive Leadership we ask the question, **"Who
          are you being while you’re doing what you’re doing?"** We look at the
          character of our leadership in addition to our competence.


          This training will help you uncover your assumptions, beliefs and
          patterns; and examine how they are working both for and against the
          vision you have for your leadership. As your trainers, we are
          committed to rigorously supporting you and standing for new
          possibilities in your life.

          Sometimes in life we say things like, “I don’t know,” “I’m confused”
          or “I’m stuck.” When our words fail to capture our reality, art steps
          in.


          A blend of coaching and creative expression, Wine & Wonder is a
          workshop designed to explore yourself as an artist. You will unlock
          your creativity through art expression, experiential exercises, free
          writing, guided conversation, mindfulness and feedback.
